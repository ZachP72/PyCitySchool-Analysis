# PyCitySchool-Analysis
Using Anaconda and Python to analyze scores from school tests

## Purpose
A school district wanted data on math and reading scores of the districts high schools and their students. After review from the board it had appeared that Thomas High School's 9th grade class was cheating. The school board then asked for that data to be removed and analzed again for comparison. 

## Results
To determine how taking out the 461 9th graders at Thomas High School would affect the score, I turned their schools data to null data. This then lead me to recalculate the percentages of passing math and reading scores, as well as overall passing. The reason why the total count of students didn't change was because the count was run of the students ids. After removing the Thomas High School 9th graders the impact of the data made almost no change.
